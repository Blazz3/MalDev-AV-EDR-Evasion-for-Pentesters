Environment Setup

This exercise is ideally already completed before the workshop is started. In this exercise, we will set up the development environment needed to complete the workshop.

For this workshop you will need the following hosts:

1) Development / Target Host: A Windows 10 VM with Visual Studio .Net development installed, and Windows Defender with an exclusion added to the folder where we will be developing our projects ("Testing" folder in this case).

2) Attacker Host: A Kali VM 

In case you already have these things set up, feel free to skip over this lab.
